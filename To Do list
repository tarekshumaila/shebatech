To Do list-
Menu -
	- test to make sure it is good for mobile, iphones etc..
    - Fix hover on the menu ---important--- with respect to all screens
    - animate the transition from each section when clicking a menu item (ex: istanbuilt.com make it as a reference)
    - add back to top button
	
Slider:
    - (done)animate captions on slides
    - (suggestion) remove background and make the icons svg? that way we can animate the image then the caption? maybe move this to version #2 when we feel like it?
    - (this is going to be hard) add back and forth buttons for slides (its so frustrating now) - we need two functions, one to grab the next slide, and one to get the previous slide. Doable but takes time. bleary version two
